### All the things

"The master does not seek fulfillment" but I still feel the desire for it, in many ways. There are many projects that I wish I could embark upon and complete, and hopefully they would be of value to the world, and perhaps they are being pursued at length now. They are listed below here. 

1. An annotation of Wealth of Nations, containing all the interesting examples and digressions that aren't expressed in the table of contents.
2. An investigation with the neural mechanisms of insight learning, and original contribution to that field. It is so mysterious to me. 
3. A better piano that combines with electronic music to improvise. 
4. An AI that can improvise and jam. 
5. A dialog AI, which is my latest idea, and I'm writing about it, something that can find news articles and use them to create a dialogue like below.

ex.
Biden denounces the Russian invasion.
Western countries still buy oil from Russia.
Russia and the Russian government are not the same thing. 
Russian oligarchs support the Russian invasion, says a recent interview.
Government is not an extension of the will of the people.
Government is of the people, for the people, by the people
Russia’s government is not like that. 

ex. 
FDL is better than SKU worker bc it completes the data 
Fix SAC is better because it is more expensive to run FDL 
FDL is actually cheaper because it saves us management resources
Fix SAC is better because we gotta fix it anyway, then lets see 
At least lets not rewrite in Java given the new things. 

ex. 
China is the world leader bc of many reasons
America is still the largest GDP 
China is probably larger bc of hidden population 
America is still the world reader bc it has free speech 
Actually America doesn’t have free speech
Do you really want to live the pollution of China?  

6. And there are many books I want to read.

### An initial guicde to Wealth of Nations

The guide to Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations. 

WON as a History Text. 
WON as a philosophical text. 

As it turns out, the table of contents does not capture the breadth of interesting examples for his arguments. Therefore, I annotated the table of contents with references to some of them that I found interesting. They are given only as a general reference with the aim to spark the interest of the reader to pursue the knowledge in that chapter.

Additionally, some topics will constitute a slight digression. In the chapter about education for instance, Mr. Smith has some things to say about the nature of music, which of course is related to education - as music is typically a school subject - but might also be readable outside of the context of education policy, which is the subject of that chapter. However, it is these very things that make the book so colorful and interesting. 


Thoughts on music as part of an education. 
Thoughts on the fruitlessness of young people studying abroad. 
Thoughts on the history of banking. - how to create money by taking loans from multiple banks. 
Thoughts on the futility of trying to make money at some things (back then it was fishing). 
How a pin needle was made (all the steps).

Initial thoughts on "The Wealth of Nations" 

It has been a great pleasure to have read 790 out of 1200 pages to date of this historic work. I use pages because there's quite a lot of them, and in some way, my progress is measured most by this metric than any other. That being said, there are many topics of great interest, and they all deserve a mention. Some of them, I will cover here, and hopefully I will cover more of them later. 

One of the most interesting topics is the history of money. He covers it from several angles, but the most enjoyable one is the history of banks. There is, for example, the history of many banks in Europe and the United States, how and why they came to be, and the instruments of their implementation. For example, there is the history of bank money and how it came to substitute for exchange notes. This one is particularly interesting because it highlights a tool created by banks to solve a problem, that being the issue of circulating metal currency more easily, among other things. And this is just one of the many things described in the history of banking. At the very least, it puts the current developments of money in perspective (things like crypto or just electronic money in general), and really makes one wonder where things are going. 

The general trajectory is one of moving from metal to paper, but it wasn't a smooth path. First, there were many banks, and each of them issued their own exchange notes. While this significantly improved the rate of commerce, there were many challenges, such as the problem of deteriorating coinns, but non-deteriorating paper, and also the proliferation of bank notes. In addition to technical problems such as this one, there were social problems, such as greed and ignorance of how to manage a currency, and banks failed because of this, especially when they issued too much currency. Banks were even created by various entities to save other banks, such as the Bank of Scotland, and those were successful to varying degrees. The story is of great interest because its highlights how money is a challenging tool. It's not necessarily easy to implement a currency, and governments don't always know the answer.

A few example are given of thes. One of them is the policy of Spain with regard to gold. Contrary to intuition, the vast amount of gold that they had actually hurt the economy because it reduced the value of gold, which was a currency. It also made the currency against their favor, and thus trade was against their favor. The details elude me, but the bottom line is that hoarding gold isn't always a good thing for the economy. At the same time, there is a requirement for a country to keep their money in their county, and not let all of it leave. Mr. Smith has a great deal to say about how to do that as well, so in effect one gets both sides of this concept, to the benefit of one's perspective. 

The above examples are still just a sliver of the amount of topics discussed, and rather comprise the things currently on my mind at the time of writing. Hopefully, however, they will spark some curiosity about this book, a work which is taught only in the contex of justifying capitalism. Really , there is much more, and the richness of it is really in the history. It is just as much a primary source from which to dive deep into many topics in the history of the world. 



The difference between Banks and Credit Card Processors

There is a bug in the financial industry, and it exists because banks are different from credit card companies. Both however, are necessary. For example, it is the bank’s responsibility to block a charge, but it is the credit card company’s responsibility to block the merchant (those are two different things). Because of this, it is possible for a merchant to still mischarge a customer after the the bank blocks the charge. This is because all that the merchant has to do to successful re-charge the customer is change the purchase description. Naturally, this was a surprise to hear because this division of concepts made no sense. However, it becamse clear in time, but not with out a second phone call, and that is less preferable to only needing one.

For a little back story, the occasion was my discovery that a scammer had tricked me into signing up for a worthless subscription. That it was a subscription made the situation more complex.  Over the course of my phone calls, it became clear that the meaning of ‘merchant’ depended on the person talking with me over the phone. For bankers, was a row on the balance sheet, and for the credit card representatives, it was some sort of an established relationship, or maybe it was just the metadata. Because of this distinction, the banks can only do so much, so credit card company has to step in as well. 

This time around, it didn’t that the credit card company knew this. For instance, my inquiry got redirected three times between the two entities, and during the calls, there appeared to be no direct knowledge of this distinction between them. After all was said and done, the only person who knew about it was the first banking representative. That was even interesting in itself because he gave me valuable knowledge. Yes, it is true that bank and cc companies (also called ‘processors’ I have learned) are distinctly different, and for important reasons. It was surprising that this particular fact about the banking industry had escaped my own understanding for so long, along with many others, I am sure.

Thankfully, everything was taken care of; the banks handled the communication with the payment processor. If there was some way to have avoided all of that confusion, then here is a great business opportunity. 


Machines

Machines are much more than contraptions made of steel and silicon. In fact, they are entire companies. A better definition is: a system that produces something reliably. Under this definition, humans can be part of the machine too. As such, my human body and mind are part of a machine, and in exchange for it plugging into the machine, out comes money. With that money, it can enjoy the fruits of other machines, and around the world goes. 

It shocked me to realize this. Naturally, it was during my first job that made ‘real’ money. Now of course, ‘real’ money is meant to mean money that goes beyond the bare subsistence. With a bunch of extra money, suddenly there was the requirement to make some decisions about what to do with that money, and that prompted all of these questions about the meaning of civilization. At this point, the choices are either to spend it or save it, and what most people do is save it for the future when they are old and no longer able to work.

It really made me wonder about the point of having a body in the first place. After all, I should be able to go to work without having to do anything…if there is the sufficient amount of machinery to read my thoughts. This line of thinking, however is extremely depressing because it turns a human being into a battery. This is not what I want to be, ever ever ever.

Still, I feel like one at times, probably because I see the point of my life being to help others. After all, that is the whole point of these machines: to enable others to achieve their dreams. In the case of my first job, those dreams were of cooking fine food. My job existed to make sure that people had high quality cookware for that express purpose. So, humans definitely cannot be reduced to a battery. That is, a human cannot be both a battery and a fine chef at the same time. Realizing this, I knew I was in a contradiction. 

The question remains of what is to be done with that extra money? One idea was to embark on some selfish idea, like a recording project, but then leaves the person right where they were. Or, perhaps not. Maybe that recording project is the window to something brand new and unexplored…if people listen to it. At the very least, there has to be some value in spending the money, because that is why money is spent. 

So right now, it all just sits in that portfolio at the advice of my (very successful) grandfather. Let it sit there and accumulate until it makes sense to retire. Yet, it is hard to even determine the meaning of that phrase. Probably, it means the age where it is better to just sit around and judge others. It would be nice if someone hired the person to do it, but it may as well be from one’s front porch, if nothing else.

<a name="8/21/2021">An automated orchestrator for instrumentalists</a></br>

<p>In my opinion, there are many great ideas for software that helps with music making. One of them is a tool for changing the timbre of musical phrases in a pleasing way. This would be at the piano, or any instrument that doesn’t control its timbre, generally speaking, since the timbre is in fact different depending on the voicing, but this is negligible. The truth is that piano is one timbre, but in doesn’t have to be that way. 
	</p>
<p>It would be software for real time performance. The way it would work is that the performer would play the music and the machine would change the timbre of phrases and voices. When a phrase ended and a new one begins, a new timbre would take effect, and ideally this would sound better than the same timbre. The effect would be that the listener would hear an ever changing sound scape of timbres rather than just the piano. It would be a real-time orchestrator, in other words. 
	</p>
<p>To do this would require that the machine know what is going to be played before hand, and perhaps very intimately. This is because the machine needs to know the beginning and ending of phrases, and that is not something even a human can easily know during the first listen of a piece. Therefore, a certain amount of training the software, or ‘prepping’ may be a better word, where the software learns what it going to be played, and it prepares a sort of mental map.
	</p>
<p>Naturally, it’s important to keep some of the spontaneity in performing, so the software wouldn’t have to stick to the same orchestration every time. Ideally it would change and evolve its own interpretation of sorts, and this interpretation can be guided, and certain parts of it reinforced.  Hopefully, it would try out new timbres, and the performer would select which parts were good, which parts added to the intended effect. Speaking of it like this, the software really would add a new layer to classical music making, and probably some would welcome it and others will not.
	</p>
<p>In the end, however, it would be a tool for discovery. The great pianist Vladimir Horowitz said to think orchestrally when at the piano, and his advice is really the essence of this idea. That is, it is to help the pianist connect this music to new sounds, to open up the ears to hear the music in new and diverse ways, to imagine all the possibilities with sound, and perhaps offer a glimpse into what a composer at that time wished sound could be, if technology were better.  	</p>

<a name="8/17/2021">A call for debugging tools</a></br>
<p>There are many great debugging tools out there, but there could be many more. One great one that exists already is remote debugging; this really impressed me at first sight because of how many moving parts are required to make it work. There are the two connections to the remote server (one for code syncing and one for communicating the debugging steps), and also the logic of stepping through the code itself. In fact, this example illustrates very well how to combine two good things into one great thing: that is, it combines the concept of debugging with remote syncing. Perhaps, future debugging tools will also arise from new combinations. </p>

<p>One field in which better debugging tools are greatly needed is in the realm of Kubernetes. Recently, it came to my attention that the flow from external network to the server port was a winding path. First, the server needs to be exposed to the right port through the Docker container. Then, the docker container needs to map to a Server Object, and lastly, an External Ingress needs to connect to the server port. In total, that amounts to at least four, maybe five different ports, and the way that engineers do it currently is to simply read the files and remember them. Naturally, it can be a challenge keep all of this in one’s head.  </p>

<p>If one of the connections is misconfigured, this will became a challenge to debug because an Ingress will only throw a 502, and that is not descriptive enough. This is because it is possible that the Ingress throws 502 for other reasons, such as a firewall, or something else related to the network. So, it would be nice if one could quickly and easily rule out port mappings.  One way would be to have a program visualize the port mappings. This would put a mental model to paper, so to speak, and really help developers see the typos.</p>

<p>Some may say that remembering ports is easy, but it’s not. This is because developers often work with combinations of 8, such as 80 or 8080 or 8081, and this can get confusing. For example, an Ingress will typically expose 80 but map to a Service port that is different than 80, but that port will likely be 8080 because 8080 is a default port in web applications. At least in a visualization, it would be easy to see the differences, and maybe even color-code them. If the argument still feels tenuous, consider that it may have been challenging to follow this paragraph with all the different ports being mentioned; now consider working with them in code!</p>

<p>The tool could be even better with a way to ping the application and stop along the way. In this way, the tool would resemble current debuggers’ ability to pause execution. The caller could read the details of the request, and inspect the node at which the request has stopped. This would be really interesting if it were possible, but it is unclear to me if such a thing is possible right now. But what is definitely possible right now is to misconfigure port mappings and not see it. It has happened to me, and my bet is that it has happened to others…and my use cases have only been for simple Kubernetes applications. </p>

<p>It would be really great to know what other Kubernetes debugging strategies are out there, but if this one were built, it would be good. It is also an example of using combinations: visualizations are combined with debugging logic, which are combined with tracing…it’s almost as many moving parts as Kubernetes itself! Maybe a simpler place to start would be an IDA plugin that analyzes helm charts along with application configurations. This would be more proactive than debugging, which at the end of the day is the best outcome. Please feel free to share your own tips for debugging Kubernetes!</p>

<a name="8/13/2021">Are the aliens here?</a></br>
<p>The aliens are here, says Steven Greer. Perhaps he is right, and perhaps he is not. No matter what, the government acknowledges that “something” is in the sky that they don’t know about. At first glance, it was exciting to think that maybe it’s the aliens, but on second thought, it’s just nice to know that the government doesn’t know everything. That’s a good thing, and it would be nice if it stayed that way. Those UAPs can keep flying around in the sky, mystifying the military. </p>

<p>Maybe the aliens are symbolic. After all, the whole point is that knowledge about them is unknown. So, in this sense they could be anything. They could be hallucinations of the mind, or they could really be 'astrally projected physical entities' that visit from outer space. The whole point is that we don’t know what they are, and that’s kind of exciting. It is also exciting to think that something out there is mysterious and unexplored, because most things in life are already explored, and those that aren’t explored are things that require responsibility. Owning a house, for instance, is an unexplored experience, but not a care-free one. Aliens, on the other hand, are risk-free. </p>

<p>No matter what, it is ultimately the mind that is unexplored. Regardless of the what the aliens are, the directive is the same: meditate. Meditate and open one’s heart. Also, pay money to see Steve Greer, but that last part isn’t necessary. It’s kind of like going to college, where the money paid not for knowledge but the degree. Knowledge is free, and so is a connection with the aliens. The money is paid for the work of a human to document it. Still, it is kind of annoying to see a 10$ app after hearing a long spiel about universal connectedness and the like, but people still have to eat.  </p>

<p>So do the aliens, probably…and maybe they take a rain check on some days. After all, it has been tempting to attend one of the CE5 expeditions, but it is expensive, and the reviews are lacking. One review said that when the aliens didn’t appear, Mr. Greer blamed the attendees for not being open minded enough. That doesn’t seem good for business. Knowing this, it makes more sense to try with a friend, and I did. In fact, we did see something unidentifiable. It was a flickering light that spun about low in the sky and then disappeared.  My friend and I both saw it, but weren’t convinced. After all, it looked like a bug, and moreover, if a UFO appeared to us, the airport right down the road would take notice as well. Then the secret would be out.</p>

<p>For others, the secret is already out. One friend told us the universe is so vast that life has to be out there, and probably already knows about Earth. Why not? God is unfathomable, and so are the possibilities in life.  From this perspective, there isn’t much to get excited about, and the directive is once again unchanging: meditate. Still, it would be be cool, as in Ezekiel 1, to see something great and awesome appear from the heavens. </p>

  <a name="7-2-2021">What’s in a word?</a><br>

  <p>A number of years ago my mother’s friend said that star NBA players work on only one thing at a time, and that the thing in question would be a very small thing. Something like how their fingers touch the ball, or how they distribute pressure on their feet, would be examples of such things. They are little adjustments, but for an expert they make a big difference. For my mother’s friend, being an expert at singing gave her the sense of what little adjustments are needed in her students. In fact, this is probably true for any expert in their respective field.</p>

<p>One thing at which we are all probably experts is communicating, and perhaps this observation applies to this field as well. Since we have all spoken for many years, we know how to use language in the myriad of ways that are available. Similarly, we would agree that some language is appropriate in some places and not appropriate in other places, and we always are tweaking it. Sometimes it can go too far, such as when an authority tries to control speech in a narrow-minded way (and this makes me frustrated).</p>

  <p>My theory is that this is what is happening in policy around what is appropriate language in the workplace, so I think we should have an open minded approach to it. For example, there is a line of thinking that says using the word “America” is a word that is less preferable in usage than something like “The States.” I however, think that this opinion is a little farfetched. For example, both words are a simplification of “The United States Of America”. It doesn’t exclude people, nor is it offensive to use the word “America” in this way.</p>

  <p>Let’s take the proposed alternative and see whether that is any more or less biased. Consider “The States”… Personally, it doesn’t seem any different to me to use this word because this is also shorthand. So, perhaps there is some context for using one word or the other. At the very least, there isn’t only the biased usage of a word, and it would make more sense to recognize that words have many contexts and usages.</p>

  <p>Anyone will know there are many Americas. There is/are the geographical place(s), there is the trope of the redneck shouting “Amerrhica,” and there is the other trope of Coming to America from the Eddie Murphy, the ‘land of opportunity.”  In fact there are many others, so don’t forget to use them for expressive purposes. This is my implementation of this particular tweak to American English.</p>

  <a name="7-5-2021">Back Bay Buildings are great.</a><br>

  <p>I was asked if reading The Malachite Casket made me want to travel to the Urals. In fact, it did not, but rather made me want to write about my own neighborhood. I have tried already to some extent, and now I have another opportunity. This time, it is about the back bay neighborhood in Boston, MA. It is a very special place, and by special I mean wealthy.</p>

  <p>There are so many magnificent buildings in the back bay. There is the Christian science plaza, a towering monument to a rather mysterious organization. To that point, I have tried to read the founder’s writings but gotten bored. For others, her writings must have had an influence because the church is one of awesome size and beauty. When I see it from my girlfriend’s apartment at night, it reminds me of the capital building. Still, I haven’t had the courage to go inside for a service, but I must before I leave this part of town.</p>

  <p>It is not the only great structure in the vicinity. There is the old Trinity church, the Boston public library, and the massive Prudential Center. In trinity church, it takes a careful walk around it to find an embedded stone sculpture of great interest, particularly for historians. That is because, this embedded stone was transported from England in the 17th century for the expressed purpose of being a building block for the church, a cornerstone of sorts. It is large, probably one thousand pounds, and circular, with a beautiful carving of a wheel. It might be the oldest thing in Boston!</p>

  <p>Then there is the Prudential Tower, a fascinating place. Of it, I know at least two things that have happened in there. First, my friend worked for an investment bank that bought failing businesses. Secondly, the economist John Perkins received his briefing somewhere in that building when he joined the government to pitch stimulus money to developing nations. Together, it seems that people in that building deal with money. It leads me to wonder if anyone in that building attends either Trinity Church or The Christian Science. If I find out, I’ll tell my old student Christopher Thompson, a young man who wondered with me one afternoon as we walked across commonwealth in Allston, marveling at its size and mystery.</p>

  <p>There are many tall buildings worth opining about. As I consider them, I’m reminded of a quote about buildings. In San Francisco, at the Battery Club on Battery Street, there is a plaque that says “Humans shape buildings, after which they shape us”. Of those in the back bay, this is definitely true, and given the number of tourists that flock here every day, it appears that many others want to be shaped too.</p>

  <a name="7-7-2021">Why programmers do exactly what you tell them.</a><br>


  <p>There was a time when an acquaintance expressed his disappointment at the work ethic of his teammates. At the time, it was hard for me to explain that his teammates were simply doing their job, but now it is apparent how I would have helped him understand his predicament.  The key is to understand the separation of responsibilities, and through some examples, it will become clear what this means.</p>

  <p>For my acquaintance, the problem with his colleagues were that they didn’t do more than he asked, but this is not something to expect from them. See, they were software engineers, and software engineers are in the business of doing exactly what is asked of them. This means that whatever is on the ticket is what gets done, and no more or less. Understandably, this would be frustrating for my acquaintance, who, being a PhD, is accustomed to the academic environment of always thinking outside the box. However, this is not the way to approach coding, primarily for two reasons.</p>

  <p>The first is because there are simply too many ways to think. Granted my acquaintance gave no examples, so a simple one will have to suffice.  Let’s say that the requirement is to sort a list of items. Already, one is going to ask by what metric that list will get sorted. Of course, there are many ways, and there will be ways depending on the data itself. Therefore, an engineer given this task will probably sort the data in the quickest way possible and call it done. This is okay, because the engineer will have delivered value, and can always improve of modify it later.</p>

  <p>Another reason is that the programming itself requires thinking outside the box. Even something simple like sorting requires quite a bit of programming skill. Therefore, it is better to not think outside the box about the requirement so that one can think outside the box about the implementation of the requirement. This is hard to understand because an average computer user wants things to be easy to use. The consequence of this is sometimes forgetting that somebody else solved many creative problems to make the computer easy to use.</p>

  <p>For my acquaintance, his way of thinking outside the box is for the product manager. Take for example a database of annotated congressional bills. This is a fairly open ended description of a potentially valuable system. In this instance, the role of the product manager is to think creatively about the ways that annotated congressional bills would be useful to people, while the programmer’s job is to program it into existence. Naturally, the two roles depend on one another: the product manager has to think within the realm of what is possible, and the programmer has the understand the vision of the app. Even though they understand one another, the labor is divided. That is why it sometimes appears that programmers aren’t creative thinkers.</p>

  <a name="7-9-2021">Zhuang Zi and Computer Systems</a><br>


  <p>My friend says some profound things. For example, yesterday he shard a teaching of Zhuang Zi, who said: “The rabbit snare exists because of the rabbit. Once you've gotten the rabbit, you can forget the snare. Words exist because of meaning. Once you've gotten the meaning, you can forget the words.” Indeed, this made me consider many things about which I wonder if I don’t need anymore. It felt quite strange to consider them because I usually try to build upon my past, a natural way to think given that, for example, one’s career is tied to years of experience. Maybe, however, there is some benefit to thinking more like Zhuang Zi.</p>

  <p>The quote reminds me the story of Socrates, who demonstrates how challenging it is to define words. For example, is the Dialogues, Socrates proves how difficult it is to define pious behavior, and perhaps that the average person actually has little or no sense of it. Yet, this is a contradiction to the intuitive notion there is in fact pious behavior.  Now, Socrates’s conclusion is undeniable if one reads the work, but there is still the question of why people have intuitive notions, and the answer is that they used to know but then forgot it in the way according to Zhuang Zi.  Perhaps it is okay that this happens.</p>

  <p>In programming computers, it is much the same way, but a programmer calls it ‘working with abstractions’. Take for example the NandToTetris course, in which the student builds a computer from scratch. First, the student builds the processor. Then, the student builds a program in assembly language that manipulates the processor. Then, the student builds a virtual machine with assembly, and finally the student builds a high level language that manipulates the virtual machine. In this example, each next level of complexity lets the student discard the knowledge that was required to build the former, and start fresh again.  In the industry, this kind of forgetting is necessary, for otherwise nothing would get done. Maybe the programmers are the people Zhuang Zi is seeking when he says “Where can I find a man who has forgotten words so I can talk with him?”</p>

  <p>It remains uncertain this applies to the fundamentals of life. For instance, a high paying job gives a person means to reconnect with his family from which he had been distant. However, once he has a connection with his family, he doesn’t forget the money. But, he can forget the things he had to go through to get the money, or to get to the place so that he could make the money. Yet, it is good to remember those experiences because a man learns from experience. Still, once lesson is learned from the experience is gained, one can forget the experience itself. So, it seems there are things worth remembering.</p>

  <p>Maybe it is also true of religion. Maybe the intuition for the mind-body duality is rooted in the experience of seeing death…of seeing the energy of a person leave the body. Yet, now that religion is part of society, it is no longer necessary to see death. It is a provoking thought, and much remains to be considered.</p>

  <a name="7-13-2021">Christianity and the Dao</a><br>


  <p>They say that one shouldn’t judge a book by its cover, but people still do it. At least, it is the case for me in my attempt to understand the beliefs of the Christian Science Church. In fact, with the Covid situation postponing worship services, it is all one can do.  As such, what that has entailed is walking by the church, marveling at the architecture, analyzing the symbolism, and pondering how such skilled builders also disdain modern medicine. There has to be a connection, hidden between the pages.</p>

  <p>The reason that it is so mysterious why they disdain modern medicine is because the old church (built in 1894) expresses an ancient symbol of reality.  That symbol is the idea of one begetting two begetting three. It is ancient because Lao Zi writes in the Dao De Jing: “Dao begets One (nothingness; or reason of being), One begets Two (yin and yang), Two begets Three (Heaven, Earth and Man; or yin, yang and breath qi), Three begets all things.” It is an expression of reality for no other reason than its intuitiveness (the east-west connection aside).  In people, for example, a man and woman together make a third, and so multiple so forth. In this way, the symbol has a basis in reality. Yet, modern medicine has a basis in reality, so it makes no sense how a Christian Scientist could believe this symbol and not medicine.</p>

  <p>It is so, especially considering a recent example. As it were, several years ago a daughter wrote how her father declined modern treatment for a foot infection that eventually killed him. The sadness in the story is not only that modern medicine could have healed the man, but that the man suffered an immense amount of pain in his death, for no reason. This was traumatic for the daughter, and it led her to research a host of other examples where the followers of Christian Science declined modern medicine to the detriment of children’s health. Needless to say, it was traumatic to read, and it made me wonder if the Christian Scientist missed the idea that the gift of reason was man’s greatest ability to heal oneself.</p>

  <p>As a counter to the above story, the modern Christian Scientist might look to a man like Joe Dispenza. As a self-proclaimed self-healer, he appears to have put the ideas of Christian Science to practice. Yet at the same time, his claims are under scrutiny for lack of clear evidence, and that his condition would have healed on it own accord anyway.  Whether his story is true or not, the question of whether self-healing is possible still remains a mystery, for the Christian Science organization has a lot of money to lobby congress for grounds to open their own kind of hospital, which must help at least somebody.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, it does not appear that the Bible has any clear answer to these questions. Christ says, “With God all things are possible” and “Ask and it shall be given” which lead one to think that one can heal themselves. Yet, this cannot be correct. Just as one cannot jump off a cliff and expect to fly, there are certain things a human cannot do by themselves. A more likely interpretation is that God’s help is in fact the ability to create modern medicine, and using it is what makes the impossible possible. That is, God’s gifts are in us already, and we must use and trust it. That gift of reason is like a mustard seed, as Christ says, that grows into a large tree. Presumably, the symbol on the church expressed this same idea, but maybe not.</p>

  <a name="7/16/2021">How Buildings are Like Mountains.</a><br>


  <p>Mountains are the same as tall buildings. I know this because I am inspired in the same way as when I am surrounded by the mountains. For example, when I leave my apartment in the morning, I look up at them and am awed by their physical qualities. Yes, they do indeed look like mountains, for they are cold, hard, and with caves on the inside, where there is usually life. Given the caves especially, it feels very much like humankind was inspired by mountains to make buildings, not a conclusion I at which I would have originally arrived.</p>

  <p>They certainly weren't inspired by jungles. Not that I've been to a jungle, but I hear that they are not made of concrete. Instead, jungles are green, lush, diverse, and teeming with a spontaneous and wet world…and they are disappearing! Cities, which we will define as a collection of buildings, are anything but. They are not disappearing, and they are not very lush, green, or diverse (cities are basically segregated). Rather, they are defined by order, rather than life, by sharp edges rather than soft, mossy stones. Yes, order is the more defining characteristic of a city.</p>

  <p>This begs the question of why cities are referred to as concrete jungles rather than mountains, or even temples. The answer is that one of the first things most naturally considered about a city is that it is dangerous. With danger naturally being associated with spontaneity, the cities acquire the reputation of having predators, but this is too assumptive. It is a simpler explanation that cities simply have a lot of people, so there are naturally more bad things. Yet, at the same, there are naturally more good things, which of course far out weigh the good things. This latter fact is not true of jungles, so much that it puts cities far away from jungles in terms of its relations.</p>

  <p>Perhaps then, it is the suburbs which are the best place to live. The Chinese, for example have said that the best place to live is between mountains and water. While there are many places that fit those criteria, it may be possible to add many more places to that list, granted that cities now count as the mountains. That would be a very wonderful thing, because then it would be possible to argue that my parents live near both mountains and water (actually they already do, but why not).</p>

  <p>In fact, the analogy just keeps going. Consider a circuit board, which will look more and more like a city once someone has a peek. Computers are, coincidentally, the most orderly thing on the planet, to the point of stupidity, in fact. It would be easy to opine on the similarities, but honestly, being around big buildings just feels more like being inside of a computers. Speaking of which, the scheduler is saying that the time has arrived to change physical locations. Would it be that order is cleanliness, which is next to Godliness.</p>

  <a name="7/21/2021">How everything is about knowledge.</a><br>


  <p>There aren’t many out there preaching what can’t be known…now, by the word “preaching”, it is meant to mean anything that is proclaimed as truth without evidence. It could even be an infomercial, or any commercial.  In these examples, the whole point of the ad is to give knowledge, and it is often the message that the consumer will like the product.  Consider Coke, a business whose commercials are simply people drinking the beverage and smiling.  That is about it, but the message is clear, which is simply that people will like the beverage, but in this hypnotic sort of way.</p>

  <p>Negative commercials are also fundamentally teaching knowledge. In an insurance commercial, for instance, the message is that one’s certainty in fallible, or put another way, that one cannot know the future. Now, this reworded message may sound like it is talking about what can’t be known, but that is not so, and it is not so because the insurance companies know the likelihood of the scenarios being insured by the policy materializing; that is precisely why the companies know that they can make money selling the insurance.  Therefore, the message is not about what can’t be known, but rather the knowledge that one isn’t special, that bad things happen to good people, there are averages, etc.  Regardless of how it is said, the message is undeniably about what is known.</p>

  <p>Now, getting back to the idea of preaching, there may in fact be one thing that is taught to be unknowable, and that is God, but even there it is hard to agree. It is because even though God is argued to be unknowable, one thing humans usually agree upon is that God cannot be seen. Actually, most religions are about getting to know God, a god, or gods, so it is more likely that the ideas about not knowing God are really about God not being able to be seen. It makes sense, but still, some biblical scholars might continue to argue the contrary using the book of Job as an example. In this story, God chastises Job for thinking he knows God’s power, but it’s really about Job failing use reason. Recall when God reminds Job that God can move mountains, and decide when the rain falls. Think, Job! Remember that you do not have God’s power. Know this!</p>

  <p>So, again, it is about acquiring or recalling knowledge. It just seems like anything referring to not knowing can be turned into the positive act of acquiring knowledge, or making a new thought-connection to solve the same problem. Still, it takes some creativity.</p>

  <p>Perhaps there is a way to describe this process in mechanical terms. One model is the yin yang, where yang is knowledge and yin is absence of knowledge. Yet, at the same time there is a little bit of each in the other. Therefore that seed in yin is the beginning of the knowledge required to explain the same concept in terms of lacking knowledge.</p>

  <a name="7/27/2021">China and Basements</a><br>


  <p>If there’s any reason why walking through that dirty basement is bearable, it is because it smells like my grandparent’s house. That is meant in a complimenting sort of way, and only on a day when the basement isn’t full of trash. On those other days, the basement just smells bad, and it doesn’t remind me much of anything. On good days, however, like this morning, it’s a nice kind of musty, reminiscent of a well used rug. It must be the reason why the basement was never immediately repulsive, for it has many repulsive qualities.</p>

  <p>The realization of the morning is akin to finding something good amongst the bad, which is something that is sometimes good, and sometimes bad. In this case, it was good because it clarified a mystery. Rather, it offered an explanation as to why the basement was something that never really bothered me.  However, there are also questionable findings of good in the bad. For example, Dan Collins thinks that the diamond in the rough in the Chinese economy is that is the most productive, and inferably the best, because it produces the most.  This is certainly a compliment to China, and at first glance probably true, but it doesn’t necessarily reveal a good investment. After all, the means do not justify the end.</p>

  <p>In an interesting kind of way, the basement in my apartment building is like how China is for America. For one, China makes a lot of stuff for Americans, but the Americans decide those things. In this way, China is still below America, figuratively and literally, but necessary for the structure of the American economy. For Mr. Collins, supply determines the economy rather than the demand, and that is the nature of the basement; it provides the supply of hot water, electricity, and a garbage pile. Specifically, the garbage pile is what China is for America because American companies externalize environmental costs to China.</p>

  <p>At the end of the day, the comparison only goes so far because China stopped buying back American recyclable metal. Yet, on the contrary, it may strengthen it because my basement also cannot be bothered to recycle.  Regarding both China and the basement, it is unclear as to why these are the cases, but what is certain is that there is a lot of trash in the world, and it has to go somewhere. For some, it just becomes then neighborhood, such as Potrero Hill in San Francisco, which is a giant trash pile. Is that good or bad for the water?</p>

  <p>People want clean water, and one thing that is great about Boston is the large amount of clean water. Water is very dirty in China, so in this way, the analogy probably ends here. The basement has many pipes that funnel this large supply of water, but nobody gets water from China (it is quite the contrary). Given that clean water (and air) beats all things, it's probably better to see China more as something that relies on America, more than the other way around.</p>

  <a name="8/6/2021">How to Play the Piano</a><br>


  <p>In playing the piano, other parts of the body are as equally useful as the hands.  This is intuitively true, given that the body obviously must use many additional muscles in order to produce the movements required to press keys.  However, the above statement is not referring to this particular fact, but rather to things less obvious. It refers to discoveries during the course of my investigation into fixing technical issues, and improving my focus.  Hopefully,  others will benefit from these observations.</p>

  <p>One of the quickest improvements that one can make to his or her piano playing is through one’s posture, specifically with regards to the head.  In fact, a doctor of osteopathy brought this to my attention during my adolescence after watching me play. She observed how I let my head fall forward instead of letting it sit erectly on top of the spine. As it turned out, the observation was good because it helped me significantly improve my technical abilities.</p>

  <p>One of the ways it did so was by freeing up the rest of me body. A simple way to experience this improvement is to sight read a piece of music and then play a memorized piece. Most likely, one’s posture will only be good during the sight-reading because performing a memorized piece easily lends itself to looking downward at the hands.  Try to overcome this inclination to look down at the hands by imagining that the head is hanging from a string.  If it done correctly, one will feel more freedom of movement in the upper body, and this will translate into the ability to suddenly play faster and with more control over the key depression. It is a liberating feeling.</p>

  <p>The trick, however, is to maintain this posture when looking at the hands. This is challenging, and the solution is really only to rely less on one’s eyes and more on one’s other senses. This includes proprioception, and an aural sense of the music. Rest assured, however, that reliance on these other senses will develop naturally with time. Moreover, it is still okay to watch the hands. To this last point, a great player to watch is Arthur Rubinstein. He is a player with great posture, and also plays amazingly. Also, do not be influenced by the multitude of great players who ignore their posture. They may figured out something that works for them, but we are not them, and for others, the piano is still playable with bad pasture.</p>

  <p>Another postural improvement that yields fine results is to correct one’s core muscles. Due to the complexity of the core, this can mean several things, but in my case it meant equalizing the distribution of tension in my groin, and activating my lower back.  Both of these issues took some time to correct (on the order of years), and will each receive its own discussion. The effort, however, was well well worth it, and without it, my piano playing would possibly not have continued at all.</p>

  <p>It may have been shocking to read that last statement, but it highlights the importance of the core in piano playing. You see, by end of my education, my piano playing had acquired a bad habit that resulted in tendonitis in my left fore arm. Specifically, it was localized to the point at which the forearm muscle connects to the elbow, and it affected the feeling in my left ring finger. Without a solution, it was painful to play the piano. On top of that, it was discouraging because playing the piano was such a meaningful part of my life.</p>

  <p>Interestingly, it turned out that one way to significantly alleviate the pain was to relax the left groin muscles. Somehow, my body had developed the habit of tensing the left groin muscles for no reason, and it was affecting the rest of the left side of my body.  My theory is that some of my attempts to play historical instruments had started me down the bad-habit road, but it could also have been the stress of playing hard repertoire under a limited time frame. In any case, it took about a year to fix the habit, but the results paid off.  By the end, my arm wasn’t perfect, but my playing was more balanced and comfortable, and that was enough to call it a win.</p>

  <p>One may still be wondering how relaxing one side of the groin equates to “distributing the tension” in my groin. The answer is that by “tension” it is meant that only the necessary muscles are activated while the unnecessary muscles are deactivated; by “distribution” it is meant that both sides of the body are equal players in the dynamic equilibrium involved in any athletic endeavor. Previously, the left side of the groin was unfairly tense compared with the right side, but now both sides are equivalent in their activation of muscles necessary for being seated.  This equivalence is the key thing to aim for…a bit non-intuitive for piano playing, where the hands are rarely performing the equivalent movement. Still, one way to achieve this is through the lower back, an analysis of which will constitute the second discussion on how to improve the core.</p>

  <p>As stated, another aspect of improving the core is the correct activation of the lower back muscles.  Actually, correctly using the lower back should occur naturally one aligns one’s head in the manner stated earlier. This is because the imagery has some effect on the entire spine, from the top to its bottom.  However, if that doesn’t work, there is an easy way to experiment with the lower back, which is simply to arch it.  Next time at the piano, play some pieces with an arched lower back, and then play the same one by letting the lower back muscles go limb. Of course, playing the piano is still passible in both case, but with an activated lower back, it should feel easier to move the arms and fingers.</p>

  <p>The reason that the upper body has more freedom and control is because the core provides a counter balance of sorts.  In truth, everyone is aware of how this works because the education system teaches Newton’s law: That every action has an equal and opposite reaction. In piano playing, it is also the same, but not always recognized. For example, the hands and arms move, sometimes vigorously, so those motions must produce an equal and opposite reaction. If one pays close attention, those reactions will surface to one’s awareness, and then one will know whether the body is correctly channeling those reactions in the proper way. Much in the same way that a punch is done as much with one’s feet as with one’s fist, the piano is played as much with one’s core as with one’s hands.</p>

  <p>How this is done on the piano will become clear through experimentation. As an exercise, lift the hands and put them on the piano. Even in doing this simple motion, paying close attention to the body will bring to awareness that other parts of the body experience force. For instance, the feet and butt will brace themselves in subtle, almost inperceptible ways. If the awareness is there, then that is a good thing, but if not, it will arise with time. In having the awareness, it will become easier to learn piano techniques where the challenge is correctly counter-balancing the body.</p>

  <p>A great example of this is the leap. Much is written about leaps but what isn’t mentioned is the importance of the counter balancing done with the feet (through the core). If the player has trouble landing jumps across the keyboard, then paying attention the lower body may yield results. It certainly worked for me. As an anecdote on this topic, the great pianist S. Richter allegedly said that the piano is played with the feet, and my theory is that he was referring to this principle of counter balancing.</p>

  <p>He’s not the only pianist to say things like that, and sometimes there is more truth to it than meets the eye.  For example, it sometimes feels that the piano is played with the mouth. The meaning behind this statement comes from the fact that music is in some ways like singing, and singing is naturally done with the mouth.  In practice, this has materialized as placing the tongue on the roof of the mouth, and closing the mouth so that the teeth touch only so gently. In practicing the habit, it became aware to me that my mouth performed extraneous movements, likely because of an attempt to ‘sing’ the music instead of playing it through the hands. With the movements of the mouth fell under my control and were restricted, my mind suddenly had more focus, and my piano playing improved. It was a surprising realization…it was as if my mind had lassoed loose energy being wasted and channeled it into the music making process.</p>

  <p>The explanation is clearly not clear, but the improvement was obvious. Everything about my playing improved, and people noticed. Mainly, it was as if there was suddenly more time to think, to listen to the sounds and react to them. This sounds, esoteric but this is what happened. As to how it works, the easiest explanation borrows from Qigong: when the tongue is connected to the roof of the mouth, the microcosmic circuit of Qi flows naturally, making everything better in the body.</p>

  <p>However, not every pianist would agree to control the mouth. Glenn Gould, for instance, always sang as he played. Unfortunately, we no longer have him around to explain his method. Still, for me, it helped because it controlled extraneous movements in my body, as mentioned earlier.  In fact, there are many other proponents for control. For example, Dorothy Taubman said that no key on the piano should be played without first placing the finger on the key and feeling the texture. Glenn Gould would probably agree with this advice, and it is certainly advocating for control at a very high level.</p>

  <p>Yet, do not misinterpret Ms. Taubman’s advice. In speaking of control, it is important to remember that one’s main goal is control not over one’s body, but over the circles that the body makes.  In thinking about it, one understands that every joint is a circle, and so is the fundamental movement of playing a piano key.  When this realization became clear, my relationship with the piano changed fundamentally. That is, the piano became more of something that is played through than something that is played. In other words, the process of learning the play the piano became more the task of programming all the circular movements my body needed to make and less about getting my fingers to the right keys.</p>

  <p>Of course, the keys still have to be played, but they are more of the byproduct rather than the goal.  When it comes down to it, this is the heart of all the different advice laid out for the reader. It is as a friend told me: “Playing the piano is about learning to move oneself, not the piano.” When stated, it feels obvious, but truly it was not obvious until he said it. Hopefully, the personal experiences and concepts laid out here will prompt revelations of a similar kind.</p>

	<a name="8/12/2021">An interview with Mr. Ravikant</a></br>
<p>	It is rare to find solutions that are constructive and nuanced, but it seems that Naval Ravikant has several to offer to the listener. One of them is an alternative to UBI, and another one is a solution to environmental problems. While not all of his opinions rang true to me, at least they had the quality of having been thought through, and could be implemented quite easily. </p>

<p>In first case, he makes a compelling argument for government investment in continuing education.  Rather than give everybody basic income, he proposes that people be entitled to government funded re-education programs. It could be every so often, such every five years. This would ensure that people always have marketable skills, and would solve the problem of getting bored in life. This solution makes a lot of sense because it empowers people, and acknowledges that “We all can’t sit around,” as he humorously stated during the interview. </p>

<p>In his solution to environmental issues, he proposes another good idea. That is, he suggests that companies sell the rights the profits from the environment in same way stock is sold. In this way, the public is incentivized to care for the environment because protecting it becomes lucrative. Now, it sounds great, but my lacking knowledge of the environmental crisis, and of economics in general, makes me less familiar with the details of such a solution. Still, at the very least, it would be easy to implement. This is because the global market infrastructure exists already, so it wouldn’t be hard to add one more commodity. </p>

<p>The interesting thing about these solutions is how they involve government. In fact, they involve government quite a lot, which surprised me because the first thing he said about himself was that he was a capitalist. This is interesting because it highlighted a misconception in my thinking, which is that capitalism implies small government, when in actuality it implies the protection of private property (not the same thing). To show this connection, he made a criticism of UBI, which he sees as a path to failure. This is because it ultimately resorts to violating the right to private property, thus his support for alternatives.</p>

<p>But, policy is not the only kind of solution on his mind.  In a final pitch, he tackles a different problem: that of human happiness. With regards to this, he makes an interesting connection, which is that happiness is peace in motion. If one is at peace, anything done will be done happily, and the way to be at peace is to meditate. Meditation, therefore, is the solution to being happy. Now, this idea is more about the nuance of the problem than the nuance of the solution. After all, meditation is easy enough, but seeing the human condition is challenging. For Mr. Ravikant, the present human condition is like an overloaded computer server, and the only way to flush it is the meditate.  It takes time and patience, but eventually it happens, after which the mind reaches a state of peace. It is probably true. </p>

<p>However, not everything he said is true. For example, it does not necessarily hold that relationships are more genuine at a small company. It may in fact follow that human relations are more genuine at a large company because the bureaucracy creates a kind of social order that lacks in small companies.  Actually, this has been my experience to some extent, but in the end, one has to find what works for them. In another vein, hopefully people make the internet work for them, rather than acknowledging Mr. Ravikant’s argument that the left won the culture wars. Culture wars are an ongoing process; the modern one goes back to Vidal and Buckley and hopefully they are continuing to this day. So, not everything Mr. Ravikant said is true.</p>

<p>All in all, it was refreshing to listen to Mr. Ravikant, particularly when he said agreeable things, such as that people should be able to do all the things in life that they want to do. However, one should always be mindful when the pleasingness of a statement is for this reason, more than the argument’s coherence. For example, it would be great to be able to do everything, but success only comes from doing one thing and not other things. How to have both…
